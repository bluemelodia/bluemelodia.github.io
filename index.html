		<p>One fine, relatively pollen-free spring afternoon in Baltimore, Maryland, Dr. Charlene Gamaldo and I were sitting in her office
		at the Johns Hopkins hospital, reviewing the storyboard that I'd created for her American Academy of Neurology-sponsored online
		sleep course. Once we'd finalized the design, we would send the storyboard to a team of programmers, who would then build the module for us.</p>
		
		<p>Although I had only a vague idea of what programmers did back then, I couldn't help but covet their ability to contribute
		significantly to the app development process. That was back in April 2013. When I quit premed in my junior year, I'd briefly
		considered switching into computer science, but believed that it was too late for me to start. However, after spending my last two
		years of college dabbling in a dozen fields, including ecology, neurology, and science journalism, I realized that coding was a
		highly useful skill in nearly all of these disciplines.</p>
	
		<p>Four months later, on September 3, 2013, I sat in the third row of a large lecture hall, filled with excitement and 
		nervousness as my Intro to Java professor told us that this class would be one of the most important classes many of us
		would take at Columbia. After much discussion with my family, I'd decided to give programming a try. I did not regret it.</p></p><br>

		<p>Sleepy Head: Survive to Sunrise is an action game where players flick away falling objects thrown by a frustrated, sleep-deprived
		pet turtle before they hit his sleeping owner. I coded, designed, and illustrated Sleepy Head during the MakeSchool Summer Academy, 
		making weekly improvements to the game based on user playtesting sessions.</p>
		
		<p>I shipped Sleepy Head in September 2014 and have showcased my game at the MakeSchool Demo Day (August 16, 2014) and the NYC
		Arcade (January 15, 2015), where it received praise from dozens of playtesters for its cute graphics and fast-paced, somewhat difficult
		gameplay.</p>

		<p>An iPhone app that I built at MHacks V with Nina Baculinao, Johnny Chen, and Manoj Gurung. Our app aims to dissuade people
		from making impulse buys by allowing them to set timers on items that they are unsure about buying.</p>
		
		<p>I implemented the push notifications feature, which sends an alert to the user once the countdown timer on an item on their
		wishlist has expired. The alert is fired once the current system time passes the expiration date of the item's timer.</p>
		
		<p>In addition, I set up a UIImagePickerController, which allows the user to take, re-take, and set photos of their items.
		I save these images and other user-specific information, including the countdown expiration time, using NSUserDefaults.</p>
